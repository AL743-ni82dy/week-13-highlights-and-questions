## Cohort Highlights

- The most fun part for Erick is using npm packages!

- API integrations such as Auth0 and google apps.

- I had a side project where I made a hex color randomizer that showed the color in the background 
   and provided its hex code on screen.

- An anonymous vegan baconator has achieved a fully hosted full stack web app!

- There are other types of stacks to learn, such as JAMstack which sounds delicious.

- Weekly challenges have been very helpful as practice.

- Slack is a ton of knowledge and helps connect at anytime outside of class hours.

Also outside of class I put together an Express + EJS movie site which allows you to search for movies and displays movie posters and IMDB info

1. After completing the React tutorial and successfully re-creating the tic-tac-toe game, I find React very interesting and am excited to learn more and implement it in the future!

1. React storefront pulling in and showing data from another port such as week 10 API store manager.  Fetch() function

Fun fact: The meaning of a response code from the server varies from API to API, and oftentimes checking response.ok might not be enough. For example, some APIs will return a 200 response even if your API key is invalid. Always read the API documentation!

2. I like how easy it is to setup tables in react using bootstrap

I like the carousel where the component cycle through the slides
