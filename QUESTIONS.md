# Questions about Code, Node, Express, React

What questions can you come up with?

## Cohort Questions

1. React- is the router component something we can wrap our code in and break out additional components? A component within a component - Routeception.

2. When calling a function within a class, are there any other rules other than you don't use the typical function syntax? Is "render" the main way this is done?

3. Is React a plant, because it needs to find a 'root' to grow?? What the heck is a 'root' in React terms?

4. What is the real difference between npm and npx?

5. We were introduced to bodyParser very briefly but I feel like it will become more important going forward. It is a middleware that sits between requests and our code- but can we learn more about what it does in more layman's terms?

6. What is a idempotent function? I can't read my notes from that topic!
