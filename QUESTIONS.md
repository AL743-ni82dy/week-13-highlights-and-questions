# Questions about Code, Node, Express, React

What questions can you come up with?

## Cohort Questions

- Can we have 10-10-10 challenges around using REACT (small CRUD exercise?)
- What are some ways to better manage burnout and paralysis analysis?
- Advice on how to maintain continuity of thought when working on a long-term project?
- How to use npkill?
- Can we have a 5 year reunion, in person?
- When the Cohort ends, and we have the opportunity to explore topics more fully, who can we reach out to with technical questions?
- How can we continue to reinforce what we have previously learned? (outside of 10-10-10)
