# Questions about Code, Node, Express, React

What questions can you come up with?

## Cohort Questions
- Do you need to learn multiple frameworks at a high end level or are you ok with just having 1 that you've "mastered" and leave the others in a "familiar" level? (React, Angular, VueJS)

- When should we use server side rendering and when should we use client side rendering?

- How do you feel about people who say you can never learn Javascript until you can make full stack applications without a framework?

- When is the best time to use a relational database vs a non relational (maybe a better question for later weeks)

- How well does Javascript transfer to Python?

- If there was one technology that this course doesnt have time to teach, and you wish you had more time to cover it, what would that be?
